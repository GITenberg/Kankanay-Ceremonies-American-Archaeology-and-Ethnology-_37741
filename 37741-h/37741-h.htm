<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Territory of the Kankanay</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Since the Kankanay have been studied very little, the
exact extent of their culture area is not at present certain.</p>
<p>The Igorot of northern Benguet, and almost all of the people living
in Amburayan and southern Lepanto, speak the same dialect, have similar
customs, and call themselves by the same name, &ldquo;Kakanay&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Kankanay.&rdquo; The people of this group have no important
cultural features by which to distinguish them from the Nabaloi, and
linguistics is the only basis on which they may be classed as a
separate unity.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of northern Lepanto call themselves
&ldquo;Katangnang,&rdquo; speak a variation of the dialect spoken in
the southern part of the sub-province, and have some customs, such as
communal sleeping houses for unmarried boys and girls, which are more
similar to certain customs of the Bontoc than to any found among the
southern Igorot.</p>
<p>It might also be mentioned that the towns of northern Lepanto are
comparatively large and compact like those of Bontoc, while the
Kankanay of southern Lepanto as well as those of Benguet and Amburayan
live in scattered settlements. Another difference is the amount of
authority exercised by the <i>baknang</i> or wealthy class. In
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name=
"pb345">345</a>]</span>northern Lepanto the <i>baknang</i> are
comparatively unimportant, while among the southern Kankanay they are
as powerful as among the Nabaloi.</p>
<p>However, the best authorities regard practically all the Lepanto
Igorot as Kankanay. This seems to be advisable at present, but it is
not improbable that a more thorough study of the Katangnang in the
northern part of the sub-province will result in their being classed as
a separate group.</p>
<p>Regarding the Igorot of northern Lepanto as Kankanay, the
territorial limits of the tribe are approximately as follows:</p>
<p>On the north, the Lepanto-Bontoc sub-provincial boundary; on the
east, the western boundary line of Ifugao; on the south, a line passing
near the southern limits of Alilem and Bacun, then through the southern
part of Kapangan between the barrios of Kapangan and Datakan, then
through the township of Atok a little north of the central barrio, and
then through the southern barrios of Buguias; and on the west, a line
passing through the foothills of Amburayan and Lepanto.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="ch1.2"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Personal Appearance and Traits</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In personal appearance the majority of the Kankanay
are very similar to the Nabaloi except for the fact that they have
hardly benefited as much through contact with the outside world. Except
in the case of those who live near the sub-province of Bontoc, it is
rather difficult to distinguish a Kankanay man from a Nabaloi.</p>
<p>The women of the two tribes are easily distinguished by a difference
in dress, since the Kankanay women wear a waist instead of a jacket,
and a plain skirt instead of the kind with the folded effect worn by
the Nabaloi.</p>
<p>In personal traits the Benguet Kankanay are similar to the Nabaloi,
but farther north the people are more self-assertive and independent.
The difference in this respect between the <i>cargadores</i> of the
various culture areas is noticeable. In Benguet they will generally
carry without protest whatever size load they are given, but in Bontoc
the <i>cargador</i> decides exactly how much he will carry. While
waiting for his load, the Benguet man will probably remain out in the
road, the Lepanto man in the yard, the Ifugao on the porch; but the
Bontoc man comes into the house and acts as if he were in all respects
the equal of the one for whom he carries. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="div2" id="ch1.3"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Industrial Life</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In agriculture and the industrial arts the Kankanay
and the Nabaloi have made about equal progress, and practically
everything that might be said of the one applies equally to the other.
The standard of living is about the same, except that as a rule the
Nabaloi have more rice. The houses and the method of their construction
are similar, but there is a larger proportion of good houses among the
Nabaloi. The household furnishings of the two peoples consist of the
same or of similar articles.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="ch1.4"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Custom Law</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The custom law of the southern Kankanay differs from
that of the Nabaloi only in unimportant details.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e592src" href="#xd20e592" name="xd20e592src">1</a></p>
<p>The order of inheritance is the same, and the general principle that
property must go to the next generation and that parents, brothers, and
uncles can hold it in trust only, applies to the southern Kankanay as
well as to the Nabaloi. Another principle of common application by the
two tribes is that all relatives of the same degree, whether male or
female, inherit equally.</p>
<p>The southern Kankanay and the Nabaloi also have similar customs in
regard to marriage, and children are betrothed by their parents in the
same way. Among the northern Kankanay the young people choose their own
spouses as they do in Bontoc.</p>
<p>Divorces among the Kankanay are rather frequent, though they claim
that they are never divorced after children have been born. I know of
two cases of divorce, however, between Kankanay wives and their Nabaloi
husbands after there were children.</p>
<p>In general, the customs of the southern Kankanay and the Nabaloi
regarding the discovery and punishment of crime are the same; but a
larger proportion of cases are settled by the Kankanay according to
their old custom law, since the Nabaloi have lately become more prone
to take their troubles to the white officials.</p>
<p>All the ordeals known to the Nabaloi for discovering criminals or
testing the veracity of witnesses are used by the Benguet Kankanay. In
addition to these they have the test called <i>manman</i>, decided by
looking at the gall of two chickens furnished by the respective
contestants. The Kankanay as well as the Nabaloi contestant always
appeals to the sun. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347"
name="pb347">347</a>]</span></p>
<p>Taken as a whole the custom law of the southern Kankanay and the
Nabaloi is the same; and judging from the information at present
available we may conclude that all the Igorot groups administer justice
according to the same basic principles.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="ch1.5"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Comparative Culture</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is little difference in the amount of general
knowledge possessed by the Kankanay and the Nabaloi, but the latter are
probably a little more advanced in this respect. Whatever may be said
of their native culture, the Nabaloi are certainly showing a greater
readiness to adopt civilization than any other Igorot people.</p>
<p>Comparing the general Kankanay culture to that of the neighboring
groups, I should say that it is lower than the culture of the Nabaloi
and higher than that of the Bontoc. In some respects it is superior to
the culture of the Ifugao or Kalinga, while in other respects it is
inferior.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">General Comparison with the Nabaloi</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Kankanay ceremonial system is similar to that of
the Nabaloi.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e629src" href="#xd20e629" name=
"xd20e629src">1</a> The rituals are the same in general purpose; they
are based on a similar belief in spirits; the important elements of
both systems are sacrifice and prayer; and the functions of the priests
are the same. The ceremonies of each group must be given in their
appropriate places, and a particular sacrifice must be offered in
connection with each, though there is probably more latitude of choice
among the Kankanay than among the Nabaloi.</p>
<p>There are Kankanay ceremonies corresponding in purpose to nearly all
the Nabaloi ceremonies, but as a rule the spoken ritual is quite
different. Some of the corresponding ceremonies are called by the same
name, and some by different names. In a few cases ceremonies called by
the same name are celebrated for entirely different purposes by the two
groups.</p>
<p>There is not the same uniformity in the ceremonies celebrated in the
various towns of the Kankanay as there is in those of the Nabaloi. As a
rule the same rituals are held in the towns of northwestern Benguet, in
Ampasungan of Lepanto, and in Bacun of Amburayan. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name=
"pb348">348</a>]</span>Buguias and Mancayan have the majority of these
ceremonies, but not all. On the other hand, a few are celebrated in the
latter towns which are unknown in the former.</p>
<p>From the data available, it seems that there is even more difference
between the ceremonies of the northern and southern Kankanay than there
is between those of the latter and the Nabaloi. It is quite certain,
however, that all the Lepanto ceremonies have not been recorded, and
when this has been done the rituals of the two sections may show a
closer resemblance than at present appears to be the case.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="ch2.2"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Spirits and Deities</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The southern Kankanay have no term by which a supreme
ruler of the universe is designated, and it is doubtful if any
Kankanay, with the exception of a few who live near the coast, have any
conception of such a personage. The translation of
&ldquo;Lumawig&rdquo; as God in connection with the description of some
of the ceremonies presented in Robertson&rsquo;s publication on the
Lepanto Igorot,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e647src" href="#xd20e647"
name="xd20e647src">2</a> may be explained by the tendency of the
<span class="corr" id="xd20e653" title="Source: Ilokano">Ilocano</span>
township secretaries who did the recording, to interpret Igorot rituals
in terms of the Christian religion.</p>
<p>It seems that all the Igorot tribes that have so far been studied
recognize Lumawig as one of their great culture heroes. The Benguet
Kankanay say that he once lived on earth and was one of them, and that
when he died his soul did not go to the mountains with the souls of the
other Igorot, but ascended to the sky, where it still remains with the
souls of Kabigat, Amdoyaan, and the other great heroes of the past. All
the culture heroes are objects of worship.</p>
<p>The <i lang="phi">kakading</i> are the souls of the dead. They go to
the mountains but sometimes return to their villages and cause sickness
in order that sacrifice will be necessary. The <i lang="phi">tanong</i>
and <i lang="phi">amud</i> are souls of ancestors.</p>
<p>The Kankanay as well as the Nabaloi believe in the existence of
spirits other than the souls of the dead, which cause sickness or bad
luck. Their concept of the special functions of each class of spirits,
however, is not in all cases the same as that of the Nabaloi. The
belief in the <i lang="phi">amdag</i> which catch the souls of the
living with a net, and in the <i lang="phi">pasang</i> which prevent
the birth of children, is common to both tribes. On the other hand, the
<i lang="phi">ampasit</i> and the <i lang="phi">timungau</i>,
malevolent spirits of the Nabaloi, seem to be regarded rather as
culture heroes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb349" href="#pb349" name=
"pb349">349</a>]</span>by the Kankanay. In addition to the <i lang=
"phi">amdag</i> and the <i lang="phi">pasang</i>, the southern Kankanay
recognize the following:</p>
<p>The <i lang="phi">dagas</i>, spirits which live with the people in
their dwelling houses.</p>
<p>The <i lang="phi">bilig</i>, spirits which live in the pasture or
timber lands near the settlements.</p>
<p>The <i lang="phi">pinading</i>, spirits which live in the high
mountains, and correspond in some respects to the <i lang=
"phi">kakaising</i> of the Nabaloi.</p>
<p>The Kankanay belief in Messeken, Akodau, and the other inhabitants
of the underworld is the same as that of the Nabaloi. The belief
regarding the underworld seems to be held in common by all the Igorot
tribes and to extend to the Tinguian of Abra.</p>
<p>The Kankanay in a very few ceremonies pray to the sun and moon, but
it is not probable that they pray to groups of stars as do the Nabaloi.
The elements are frequently personified in the sacred stories, but it
is not probable that prayer is offered to them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="ch2.3"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Purpose</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Kankanay make ceremonies for the same general
purpose as the Nabaloi. The majority of them are celebrated primarily
against sickness, or to avert calamities, such as crop failure.
Incidentally, all public ceremonies secure the good will of deities and
spirits, and cause the giver to live long, be lucky, and become rich.
The matter of personal pride and desire of power is also an important
factor, and it is said that the most expensive ca&ntilde;ao celebrated
by some of the Lepanto Kankanay is given for no other purpose. I think
this is doubtful, however, and believe it probable that all
ca&ntilde;aos possess some religious significance, even when the givers
have a material motive.</p>
<p>Another reason for ceremonies given by a member of the Kankanay
<i>baknang</i> might be interesting. He stated that if he did not give
the <i>mandit</i> and other public ca&ntilde;aos at frequent intervals,
all his livestock would be stolen, but that as long as the people knew
that they would consume the larger number of his animals, they were
willing that he should have the trouble and responsibility of raising
them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="ch2.4"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Priesthood</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As with the Nabaloi, the <i>mambunong</i> is an
institution; though the Kankanay have more occasions on which they
address the spirits and deities without his intervention than the
Nabaloi. Except in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350"
name="pb350">350</a>]</span>Buguias the ceremonies are not shrouded in
mystery to the same extent that they are among the Nabaloi, and the
people have more general knowledge concerning them.</p>
<p>The compensation allowed the priest is about the same as among the
Nabaloi, and the priests appoint their successors in the same way; that
is, by selecting the one to whom the prayer is taught.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="ch2.5"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Divination</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Anap</i>, meaning &ldquo;to find out,&rdquo; is the
general name for the Kankanay divination ceremonies. Three methods are
used.</p>
<p>The <i>mambunong</i> puts <i>tapuy</i> in a glass and prays, asking
the gods to show what caused the sickness and what ceremony should be
celebrated to effect its cure. He then looks into the <i>tapuy</i>
where he sees something indicating the cause of the sickness and the
ceremony to be celebrated. This method corresponds to the Nabaloi
<i>bakno</i>.</p>
<p>A stone is suspended by a string, the <i>mambunong</i> prays, the
various rituals are named; if the stone moves at the mention of a
ceremony, that one must be celebrated. This method corresponds to the
Nabaloi <i>sabat</i>.</p>
<p>An egg is stood on end on the ground, the rituals are named, and the
one to be given is determined by the falling of the egg. This
corresponds to the <i>buyon</i> of the Nabaloi, except that the latter
use a stick instead of an egg.</p>
<p>The examination of the gall of a chicken is used to determine
whether or not one will be lucky in doing a certain thing, or whether a
sick person will recover. This divination is called <i>manman</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="ch2.6"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Spoken Ritual</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As with the Nabaloi, the spoken ritual consists of
either a petition or a story which serves as a magical formula. The
formula seems to be used to a greater extent by the Kankanay than by
the Nabaloi. The prayer or formula must always be uttered at the
appropriate place and in the proper circumstances, or else it will not
be effective. The use of the formula as well as the prayer seems to be
common to all tribes of the Igorot including the Tinguian.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e783src" href="#xd20e783" name="xd20e783src">3</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href="#pb351" name=

</div>
<div class="div2" id="ch2.7"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Dancing and Songs</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is no dancing in connection with the private
ceremonies; but the <i>tayo</i>, a dance by one man and woman at a
time, forms a part of nearly all public ceremonies. The dance is the
same as the <i>tayau</i> of the Nabaloi except that the Kankanay dance
to faster time. The time is faster among the northern than among the
southern Kankanay.</p>
<p>While the dance is in progress the <i>mambunong</i> shouts the
following at intervals of about ten minutes to the man who is
dancing:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p lang="phi" class="first">Baliwatak sika; matagoga, maganakka;
bomaknangka; bomaknang ab&#363; tomoi mans&#299;da; bamaknang ab&#363;
babay&#299; manadong tauwadi, kasinsinopantaka si oaoay.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>I give you this blessing: may you live long, may you have children;
may you be rich; may the giver of this ceremony also be rich; may the
women dancing also be rich, so that there will be our gathering
together always.</p>
</div>
<p>While the <i>mambunong</i> is reciting the <i>baliwak</i>, the man
stops dancing, but the woman continues. The <i>baliwak</i> corresponds
to the <i>datok</i> of the Nabaloi.</p>
<p>The typical dances of the Nabaloi and the Kankanay are very similar,
but this can not be stated of the dances of any of the other Igorot
tribes. The Bontoc, Ifugao, Apayao, and Kalinga dances all differ
considerably, and even the most common dances in various towns of the
same tribe differ to such an extent that an inhabitant of one town can
not take part in a dance of another.</p>
<p>Sacred songs form a part of the worship in connection with the
Kankanay <i>mandit</i>, <i>palis</i>, <i>tamo</i>, and <i>bindian</i>.
The <i>badio</i>, which is an extemporaneous chant similar to the
<i>badio</i> of the Nabaloi, is always sung in connection with all
ceremonies if there is sufficient <i>tapuy</i> on which to become
intoxicated, but it is not regarded as a part of the worship.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="ch2.8"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Omens and Taboo</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Kankanay pay even more attention to omens in
connection with rituals or in their ordinary occupations than do the
Nabaloi. Snakes, lizards, or certain birds crossing the roads are omens
of bad luck. If anything falls, if a rock becomes detached and rolls
down the hill, or a person stumbles, some calamity is sure to follow
unless it can be averted by means of ceremonies.</p>
<p>The taboos among the Kankanay are even more numerous and last longer
than among the Nabaloi. This may be partly due to the fact that the
Kankanay are a more primitive people. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb352" href="#pb352" name="pb352">352</a>]</span></p>
<p>The taboo and the belief in omens is common to all the Igorot
tribes, and the latter is prevalent to some extent among many of the
lower class Christian Filipinos.</p>

<h3 class="main">Bindian</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The <i>bindian</i>, called by the Kabayan Nabaloi
<i>bindayan</i>, is celebrated in Buguias, but in no other Kankanay
town. The ceremony is held to cure or to prevent sickness, or in
compliance with a promise made while a person is sick.</p>
<p>In general, the celebration is similar to that conducted in Kabayan;
but in Buguias instead of the dummy head being carved to represent the
head of a person, it represents the head of a snake. In the
<i>bindian</i> song for Buguias, the deeds of the heroes who went to
Legleg and succeeded in killing two large snakes which had been
responsible for the death of a large number of people, are
commemorated. The <i>olol</i>, instead of representing the takers of
human heads as they do in Kabayan, represent the persons who killed the
snakes.</p>
<p>As among the Kabayan Nabaloi, hogs are used for sacrifice, and the
dancing is the same in the two towns. The prayer is also similar.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355" name=
"pb355">355</a>]</span>As a rule the celebration is not conducted on so
large a scale in Buguias as it is in Kabayan, and fewer people
attend.</p>
<p>I do not know whether or not this ceremony is given in any of the
Lepanto Kankanay towns, but I have seen a dance in Bagnen which is
similar to the <i>bindian</i> dance. The Igorot farther north have
their head-taking celebrations, of which the <i>bindian</i> seems to be
a survival.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="ch3.2"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Mandit</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The <i lang="phi">mandit</i> of the Kankanay
corresponds to the <i lang="phi">pachit</i> of the Nabaloi. The Nabaloi
use the word <i lang="phi">manchit</i>, meaning &ldquo;to celebrate the
<i lang="phi">pachit</i>.&rdquo; The Kankanay always substitute
&ldquo;d&rdquo; for the &ldquo;ch&rdquo; of the Nabaloi.</p>
<p>However, there is a difference in the purpose for which the Nabaloi
and the Kankanay of Kibungan and surrounding towns celebrate this
ceremony. In Kibungan it is given neither to cure nor to prevent
sickness, but only to cause the person celebrating it to become rich
and to be honored by the people. In the Kankanay town of Buguias it is
celebrated to cure or prevent sickness as well as to enhance the
prestige and to increase the wealth of the giver.</p>
<p>The following is an account of a <i lang="phi">mandit</i> which I
saw on the 3rd and 4th of October, 1916, at the house of Damadan, a
rich Igorot living in Kibungan:</p>
<p>The ceremony began about nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning. The
<i lang="phi">mambunong</i> took a cocoanut shell filled with <i lang=
"phi">tapuy</i>, and squatted in front of the house. He then prayed as
follows, while holding the <i lang="phi">tapuy</i> in his hand:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p lang="phi" class="first">Sikayao ay pinading ay kayilinganmi,
ipitik&#277;nmi dakayos nan tapuy ut makikan kayo; ut adayo golgolidan
di pakan&#277;nmi.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>You, the <i lang="phi">pinading</i> living near us, we are giving
you <i lang="phi">tapuy</i> and food to eat and drink with us; so do
not permit what we feed to have a skin disease.</p>
</div>
<p>The old men then squatted around in a group and sang the
<i>bayog</i>, which is as follows:</p>
<div class="lgouter">

</div>
</div>
<p class="first">After singing the <i lang="phi">bayog</i>, the people
danced and drank <i lang="phi">tapuy</i> until noon, when twelve hogs
which were to be killed were tied and put in a row in front of the
house. Just before the first hog was killed the <i lang=
"phi">mambunong</i> prayed the prayer which is called <i lang=
"phi">batbat</i> in Kibungan. It is as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p lang="phi" class="first">L&#363;mawig un Kabigat, si Pati, si

<p>Lumawig and Kabigat, Pati, Soyaan, Amdoyan, Wigan, Bintauan, Bangan,
Bogan, <span class="corr" id="xd20e1605" title=
"Source: Obogan">Obongan</span>, Obung, Laongan, Singan, Maodi, Kolan,
Moan, Angtan, Gatan, Angban, Mantalau, Balitok; we are giving this to
you that we may live long. Work for us to become rich so that while we
live there will be the giving of meat <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb357" href="#pb357" name="pb357">357</a>]</span>to us by our
companions; so that you the gods will have things given to you; so that
our children will have life; so that there will be gifts for you.</p>
<p>What we feed increase, so that there will be celebrations of
ceremonies again. Cause our chickens also to live to be for keeping us
alive. Make what we plant also to live; beans to live; camotes to live;
to be for keeping us alive. Make what we plant, also, pineapples and
coffee, to have much fruit, so that we may have it to sell, that we may
have something with which to buy blankets.</p>
</div>
<p>The hogs were then killed, and after the meat was cooked the same
prayer was repeated. After the people had eaten, they began to dance
and sing again and continued to do so throughout the night; but only a
small number of those who were present during the day remained. The
majority went home, taking with them part of the meat which had been
left.</p>
<p>The second and third days were similar to the first; but fewer
people attended, and fewer hogs were killed.</p>
<p>The <i>mambunong</i> stated that, if after a person has celebrated
the <i>mandit</i>, a stone should become detached from the hillside and
roll down near his house, or if there should be a slide near, it would
be necessary for him to kill another hog, and have the <i>mambunong</i>
pray the following prayer:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p lang="phi" class="first">S&#299;ka ay napolug ay bato nay ay
okaamka, ut bomaknangak ut adakna bitbitbitug. Mataguak ab&#363; ta
maobananak.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>You, the falling stone, I am giving you this so that you will make
me rich and will not make me poor. Cause me to live also until my hair
is white.</p>
</div>
<p>While this ceremony corresponds in general to the Nabaloi
<i>pachit</i>, the song and prayer are entirely different. In the
<i>pachit</i> the prayer is addressed principally to the souls of dead
relatives, while in the <i>mandit</i> the hero deities are addressed.
The prayer and song resemble more closely those for the Nabaloi
<i>bindayan</i> than those for the <i>pachit</i>. It is not improbable
that when the <i>bindayan</i> or its equivalent became obsolete among
the Kibungan Kankanay, a part of it was incorporated in other
rituals.</p>
<p>The corresponding Lepanto Kankanay ceremony is variously designated
as the <i>bayas</i>, <i>bagnas</i>, and <i>daaus</i>. The corresponding
Ifugao ceremony is called <i>bumayah</i>.</p>

<h3 class="main">Batbat</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The <i>batbat</i> is given in all Benguet towns, by
the Kankanay as well as the Nabaloi, to cure or prevent sickness and to
bring riches and long life to the giver. The ceremony is held for the
same general purpose by both tribes, but the manner of celebrating it
is different.</p>
<p>In the Kankanay towns from one to twelve hogs may be used for this
ceremony. The number varies according to the wealth of the giver.
Unlike the Nabaloi they do not pretend to deceive the spirits by tying
hogs which are not to be killed. The following story regarding this
difference was related in Legleg,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1707src"
href="#xd20e1707" name="xd20e1707src">2</a> a barrio of Kapangan:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p lang="phi" class="first">Ud nabaon si L&#363;mawig winatwatun
if&#363;gau g&#363;d&#363; ta siay ad&#363;&#363;m si okana. Gomosad

<p lang="phi">S&#299;a say gapona ay iwud d&#299;idawat si Iloko sin
batbat, mo din Inibiloi ya anda si &#363;saloi, mo di Kankanay pay
yaanda si adad&#363;.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Long ago Lumawig gave the people hogs so that they would give some
of the increase. When he came down from the sky to the Ilocano country
and asked for hogs, they did not comply. He asked the Nabaloi; they
knew how to give him one and pretend that many were given. When he
asked the Kankanay, they gave him many.</p>
<p>This is the reason the Ilocanos do not celebrate the <i>batbat</i>;
why the Nabaloi give one (hog) only; why the Kankanay give many.</p>
</div>
<p>Before each hog is killed, the <i>mambunong</i> prays as follows
while holding a cup of <i>tapuy</i> in his hand:</p>

<p>After the hog has been killed, the <i>mambunong</i> takes the stick

</div>
<p>The prayer recorded above is used in Legleg and all the other
Kankanay barrios of Kapangan, but in Kibungan the prayer recorded under
the <i>mandit</i> is also used for <i>batbat</i>. In Buguias the souls
of the dead and the malevolent spirits as well as the deities are
addressed, and the prayer as a whole is probably more similar to the
Nabaloi prayer for <i>batbat</i> than to the one recorded above.</p>
<p>Dancing the <i>tayo</i> forms a part of this ceremony in all Benguet
Kankanay towns.</p>
<p>The ceremony may last from one to three days, and is generally more
expensive than the <i>batbat</i> of the Nabaloi. As a rule more hogs,
<i>tapuy</i>, and rice are used.</p>
<p>It will be noted that in the prayer used by the Kankanay for
<i>batbat</i> only the deities are addressed, while the Nabaloi not
only relate a sacred story, but also petition the souls of ancestors,
the <i>pasang</i>, and some of the constellations.</p>
<p>In some respects the Lepanto ceremony called <i>keslei</i> resembles
the <i>batbat</i>.</p>
<p>Among the Benguet Kankanay as well as the Nabaloi the term
<i>saad</i> is used to designate the <i>batbat</i> on a small
scale.</p>

<p>A hog, <i>tapuy</i>, and rice are necessary. Just before the hog is

<p>I have never seen this ceremony in any of the western Benguet

sacrifice. The <i>mambunong</i> holds the chicken in one hand and
squats beside the <i>tapuy</i> and rice while he prays.</p>
<p>He begins his prayer by addressing the <i>amlag</i> of the various
settlements from the coast town of San Fernando, La Union, to the place
where the ceremony is held; and then requests that if any of them have
captured the soul of the sick person, they release it in exchange for
the food, <i>tapuy</i>, and tools.</p>
<p>This ceremony is celebrated for the same purpose as the <i>amdag</i>
of the Nabaloi; but no sacred story is told by the Kankanay

<p>The <i>palis</i> is celebrated by the Nabaloi and the Lepanto

all Igorot tribes, since a belief in witchcraft is prevalent throughout

called to him saying that it was time to go home. Kabigat did not
answer, but continued to build fence. His wife became angry and began
to scold, but when she turned around she saw the Thunder standing near.
The Thunder said, &ldquo;Do not become angry with your husband. He does
not answer because he can not hear you. I made him deaf. If you want
him to be cured get one chicken and one jar of <i>tapuy</i> and
celebrate the <i>buang</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bangan did so and Kabigat was cured. Then they handed this down to

<p>There were two brothers, the Timungau. They went to get
<i>camotes</i>. They found one <i>camote</i> the root of which went far
into the ground, and they dug after it and found a wide stone. They
turned it over. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366"

<p>They looked into the opened place, and their eyes saw to the
underworld. They saw there a house, and there was being celebrated a
ceremony in the underworld. Then they got their rope and fastened and
tied it, and it was this way they went to the underworld.</p>
<p>Then they arrived at the ceremony. They went to eat. They were
eating when they heard the inhabitants of the underworld say, &ldquo;We
will catch you so that we may eat you.&rdquo; Then they became afraid,
and took off their breech-clouts and tied them on the door so that it
would be thought they were there. This they did.</p>
<p>Then they caught them, and one of the brothers said, &ldquo;Do not
kill us because I will marry your daughter.&rdquo; Then they did not
kill them, and he married one of the daughters of Maseken. Then Maseken
said, &ldquo;Let us go to hunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went below, but the son-in-law stayed in the trail. Maseken and
his companions went, and ran after an old carabao. They arrived at the
place of the son-in-law, and he saw that an old woman was running at
the place they were hunting.</p>
<p>Then he did not lasso her, but let her go; then he went away.
Maseken arrived and scolded his son-in-law, and then ran after the old
woman, their mother, and caught her and wounded her. Then the
son-in-law said, &ldquo;We do not like to eat people.<span class="corr"
id="xd20e2246" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> Then Maseken said,
&ldquo;Return, if you do not like to eat people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they returned to the top of the ground and said, &ldquo;We will
get the rope so that there is something for making a net so that we can
catch our food with the net.&rdquo; Then they made a net so that there
was something to net people with. Then the two brothers said,
&ldquo;Take this in order that you may eat.&rdquo; But Maseken said,
&ldquo;They will give us rope and chickens, because if they do not give
them to us we will catch the people with the net.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were a brother and sister, Bogan and Singan. Bogan was a woman
and Singan was a man. They had children, two boys. The larger was
Pintun, the smaller was Liblibian.</p>
<p>When they became older they did not eat. Their father gave the
cooked rice from the center (of the pot) and the center of the liver,
but they did not like it.</p>
<p>One day when their father and mother had gone to cultivate the land
and had returned, they had already eaten one-half of their pot. They
said, &ldquo;How is this? you like to eat iron pots.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,
iron is what we like to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Liblibian and Pintun left together and went to the land of the
Ilocano. When they arrived they made one child of an Ilocano sick so
that there would be a reason for giving them bolos to eat. The Ilocano
did not know enough to give them bolos to eat, but knew of medicine
only. They said, &ldquo;Oh! The Ilocano do not know the prayer, so let
us go to Igorot land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went to Igorot land and made sick one child of an Igorot. He
took at once one chicken and fifteen bolos and held the ceremony

was cured at once.</p>

<p>Long ago there were a man and his wife who had a daughter named
Ampasit. One day Ampasit went to get <i>camotes</i>. While she was on
the way, a son of Timungau hid the girl Ampasit. For a long time the
father of Ampasit could not find her. He thought that Ampasit was
dead.</p>
<p>One day when the parents of Ampasit had gone to bathe, they saw
Ampasit standing on a large rock. Her father said to her, &ldquo;Where
have you been?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;I married the son of Timungau,
and he hid me here.&rdquo; Her father called her to the house and gave
a ceremony, and invited Timungau and his family. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368" name="pb368">368</a>]</span></p>
<p>After Timungau and his family had finished eating, they went home.
Timungau was ashamed, and celebrated a ceremony also. He invited
Ampasit and her father and her mother.</p>
<p>When Ampasit and her father and her mother went to the ceremony of
Timungau, they wondered how the pigs in the yard were tied, because
they did not see, although they were looking.</p>
<p>The father of Ampasit urinated. He urinated on the face of the
husband of Ampasit, because he did not see him. Timungau said,
&ldquo;We do not wish to have Ampasit married to our son, because even
at our own house they urinate on our faces. We will make them sick so
that they can not urinate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So that they might get cured of the sickness, the father of Ampasit
had a ceremony, and taught the people what to say in order to celebrate
it.</p>
</div>
<p>The <i>ampasit</i> of the Kankanay is entirely different from the
ceremony of the same name celebrated by the Nabaloi. The Kankanay
<i>ampasit</i> corresponds in purpose to the Nabaloi <i>basil</i>.
There is no similarity, however, in the spoken rituals of these two
ceremonies.</p>

<p>A chicken and a jar of <i>tapuy</i> are necessary for sacrifice. The
<i>mambunong</i> holds the chicken in one hand, a cup of <i>tapuy</i>
in the other, and relates a version of the story recorded under the
<i>bilig</i> (p. 377); but he adds that after the quarrel both the Wind
and the Lightning became covered with sores, and that in compliance
with the advice of Lumawig the <i>dayau</i> was celebrated in order
that a cure might be effected.</p>
<p>After the ceremony the patient bathes while saying:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">I am bathing for <i>dayau</i>. May my sores be cured.
May I be like you, Water, free of sores.</p>

<p>The ceremony is very similar to the <i>diau kasib</i> of the

<p>There were Bintauan and Apinan. They were brothers. They did not
have children, and when their wives had their menses, they were sick in
the abdomen.</p>
<p>They went then to get some one to make the divination ceremony. They
found a stone house; a large tall man with green eyebrows came out of
it. Then Bintauan and Apinan asked him to make the divination ceremony
so that they could learn what troubled their wives. Then he said,
&ldquo;Go to the Sun and Moon because they know the divination
ceremony.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb370" href="#pb370"

<p>Then Bintauan and Apinan went away. They arrived then at the meeting
place of the earth and the sky. There was a large house. A red-eyed man
with green eyebrows came out of it. &ldquo;For what reason did you
come?&rdquo; &ldquo;We came to cause the divination ceremony to be
made, because when our wives have their menses they get sick and do not
have children.&rdquo; &ldquo;I do not know the divination ceremony; go
to the Sun and the Moon, because they know the divination
ceremony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went on and saw two stones as large as a house striking each
other, where the water empties. They were afraid to go farther, but
sent their dog ahead. They saw he was on the other side. Then they
followed their dog. They arrived on the other side, where there were
many houses joined together.</p>
<p>They arrived then, and the wife of the Sun came out and said,
&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; &ldquo;We came to have the divination
ceremony made, because our wives do not have children and when they
have their menses they are sick.&rdquo; &ldquo;Come under the house
because when the Sun arrives he will wilt you.&rdquo; Then they went
under the house of the Sun.</p>
<p>When the Sun arrived, he asked, &ldquo;Did men come at noon?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes, they are waiting under the house. They came to have the
divination ceremony held, because their wives do not have children and
they get sick when they have their menses.&rdquo; Then the Sun asked
Apinan and Bintauan, &ldquo;Why did you come?&rdquo; &ldquo;We came to
have the divination ceremony celebrated.&rdquo; Then the Sun said,
&ldquo;Go home and celebrate the <i>pasang</i>, and you will have
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went home and did so and had children, and their wives were not
sick when they had their menses.</p>
</div>
<p>There is no dancing in connection with this ceremony in the western
Benguet Kankanay towns, but in Buguias the wife and husband dance. The
wife carries her <i>camote</i> basket filled with blankets,
breech-clouts, and cloth, which are offered to the <i lang=

certainly ate it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boliwan cut open his (own) abdomen with a bolo, and died. Then the
two brothers saw that there was no meat in his stomach. Then they said,
&ldquo;Although we said that you ate the meat, you should not have cut
open your abdomen and then you would not have died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they lay down and watched to see who had eaten the meat. They
saw a snake above where they were standing, and said to it,
&ldquo;Probably you ate the meat.&rdquo; The Snake answered,
&ldquo;Yes, I ate it.&rdquo; The two brothers said, &ldquo;We shall
certainly kill you.&rdquo; The Snake answered, &ldquo;Do not kill me; I
will teach you how to cure wounds, and you can make your father alive
again.&rdquo; The Snake <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href=

the spears, bolos, sticks, and rocks near the wound and prayed. Boliwan
became alive again.</p>
<p>The brothers said to the snake, &ldquo;We think you are a god
(anito).&rdquo; The Snake answered, &ldquo;Yes, I am a god.&rdquo; The
brothers said, &ldquo;We will tell the children of the people, so that

betrothed while children by their parents. The betrothal ceremony is
called <i>gaysing</i>. As a rule this ca&ntilde;ao is celebrated when
the children are very young; frequently while they are infants; and
occasionally before one of them is born.</p>
<p>One of the primary objects of the <i>gaysing</i> is to cement
friendship between the parents, and it is frequently held after they
have quarreled and pressure has been brought to bear to cause them to
become friendly again.</p>
<p>An animal, generally a cow, is killed and <i>tapuy</i> is furnished,
but there is no spoken ritual.</p>
<p>The Nabaloi custom of betrothal is the same, and the same ceremony
is celebrated.</p>

themselves without the intervention of their parents is called

been celebrated refuse to marry. Except in the case of the rich,
refusal to marry is rare, since the one who refuses must pay all
expenses incurred for the <i>gaysing</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>galon</i> is celebrated exactly like the <i>gaysing</i>.</p>

<p class="first">The marriage ceremony, called <i>mangilin</i>, is
similar to the <i>mangidin</i> of the Nabaloi.</p>
<p>A hog is always offered for sacrifice, and the <i>mambunong</i>
prays, calling the names of the sky deities and asking them to witness
the marriage. They are also requested to cause those marrying to treat
each other properly, to cause them to have many children, to cause
everything which they plant to grow well, to cause them to have luck
with their livestock, and to give them long life and riches.</p>
<p>After the prayer the <i>Mambunong</i> passes a cup of water to the
bridegroom, who drinks, and then gives the cup to the bride.</p>
<p>A taboo is effective against both the bride and groom for three days
after the ceremony. At the end of this time they go to the brook to
bathe, the man taking his ax and the woman her <i>camote</i> basket.
While bathing each one repeats a short formula, after which they are
husband and wife.</p>

<p class="first">The <i>siling</i>, or funeral ceremony, is celebrated
in all Benguet Kankanay towns, and, indeed, under various names, by the
majority if not all of the Igorot tribes.</p>
<p>Except in the case of infants or very small children the dead are
not buried immediately, but are put into a death chair around which
funeral rites are held. In the meantime animals belonging to the dead
person or his relatives are killed and eaten, while the burial is
delayed.</p>
<p>The interval between the death and the burial varies according to
the wealth of the deceased, sometimes lasting for months in the case of
the very wealthy. Even when the health authorities force immediate
burial on account of danger from infectious diseases, the <i>siling</i>
continues just the same with a dummy corpse in the death chair.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href="#pb374" name=
"pb374">374</a>]</span></p>
<p>Before anything is killed, the <i>mambunong</i> prays, asking that
the food eaten at the <i>siling</i> may not cause sickness. A female
relative then leans on the death chair and says the following:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are dead, &mdash;&mdash;. We are giving everything we can
for your <i>siling</i>. Do not come back for us, but let us live
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the <i>siling</i> ends the corpse is put into the coffin and
buried in the ground, or placed in a natural cave. The burial takes
place either in the afternoon, between sunset and dark, or in the
morning before the sun rises.</p>

<p>A carabao, a cow, or a horse may be killed when the <i>kiad</i> is
celebrated.</p>
<p>The people first take a jar of <i>tapuy</i> to the grave of that
dead relative of the sick person who is indicated by the <i>anap</i> as
having caused the sickness. A hole is made in the grave, and the

<p>The blanket is put into the grave, after which the people go to the

the rope to the <i>mambunong.</i> He then prays as follows, while
holding the rope:</p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>Soul of the dead relative, come and eat with us.</p>

<p>The people then spend the rest of the day dancing and drinking

house, and prays to the gods and spirits asking that the yield may be
sufficient for the people and that there may be enough surplus with
which to celebrate many ceremonies.</p>
<p>After the ceremony has been held at each house, the meat and

<p>There were two brothers. They went out of the house when there was a
ceremony. The people rubbed their greasy hands on them. They were sad
because they were not given food by the people. They said, &ldquo;Let
us go and make our house out of sight.&rdquo; When they had left, they
took their dogs and went to hunt.</p>
<p>While they were hunting, their dogs barked in the midst of the
forest. They went there, and they were barking at a branchless tree, a
branchless bamboo, and a branchless vine. They said, &ldquo;Let us take
them and use (them) for making our house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They took them and used (them) for making their house. Then they
were always sick, but they took one chicken and gave it to the
<i>dagas</i>. Then they handed this down to the people, and it is being
done again by the people.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The <i lang="phi">tanong</i> is a ceremony celebrated
to cure sickness caused by the souls of dead ancestors. A carabao, a
cow, a hog, or a chicken may be sacrificed, according to the wealth of
the sick person. A <i lang="phi">mambunong</i> is not necessary, but
the sick person himself prays as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p lang="phi" class="first">Yan nay ay din nouangko, ta mayilotonan din
anguk, mokon dakayo paksau sinan angut ay mansak&#299;t. Yamo si bigat
ya mataguak ya way nouangak ya andaka loman.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Here I am giving for <i lang="phi">tanong</i> my carabao so that my
body will be cured if you made my body sick. If tomorrow I am alive and
have a carabao, I will give it again.</p>
</div>
<p>The promise to make additional sacrifice is rarely kept, and I have
been told by those celebrating the ceremony that they had no intention
of keeping it.</p>
<p>After the prayer has been uttered, the animal is killed. If a
carabao or cow has been sacrificed, one of the men present cuts small
pieces from its liver and throws them in different directions, while
saying the following:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p lang="phi" class="first">Dakayo ay kakading isan nanaraban di
nouang, ya andakayo sinan ginotmo alt&#299; to pakamonyo ay inpangantka
din noung aynay.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>You, the souls of the dead in the pasture lands of the carabao, you
are given these pieces of liver that you may know that the carabao has
been sacrificed.</p>
</div>
<p>After the meat has been cooked, the sick person speaks the same
prayer which he recited before the animal was killed.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Among the Kankanay of Benguet the <i lang=
"phi">sagausau</i> is generally celebrated before starting on a
journey, and always before starting on a journey to trade.</p>
<p>A chicken is first killed and its gall examined. If the gall is full
and smooth the trader will have luck, but if the gall does not look
right, the trip is delayed and the next day another chicken is killed.
When the prospective trader finds a chicken whose gall is all right, he
then proceeds to celebrate the <i lang="phi">sagausau</i>.</p>
<p>In the western Benguet Kankanay towns, the person giving the
<i lang="phi">sagausau</i> prays as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p lang="phi" class="first">Sika agou ya boan, nay ay manaugasauak;
sina yamo amoya sin amoyak, ya yaanda sakun si galiko ya takoanda sakun

<p>You, Sun and Moon, I am now celebrating the <i lang=
"phi">sagausau</i>; and if I go, wherever I go, make them give me
blankets and sell to me cheap.</p>
</div>
<p>In Buguias, where a large number of people make their living by
acting as middlemen, between the Nabaloi and Ilocano on the one hand,
and the Ifugao on the other, the prayer which is spoken by the <i lang=
"phi">mambunong</i> is as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">You, Sun and Moon, come; witness the <i lang=
"phi">sagausau</i>. &mdash;&mdash; is about to start on a journey to
trade. May he be successful in trading. May he be able to collect all
that is due him and evade payment of what he owes. Cause the people to
give him food and blankets.</p>
</div>
<p>In the Lepanto town of Mancayan the <i lang="phi">sagausau</i> is
celebrated, but I do not know whether or not it is held in the other
Lepanto towns.</p>
<p>The <i>sagausau</i> of the Nabaloi is celebrated for a different
purpose and is an entirely different ceremony.</p>

ceremonies described in this section were recorded among the Benguet
Kankanay in the townships of Kibungan, Kapangan, and Buguias. All the
texts were recorded in Kibungan except those of the <i>kiad</i>, which
were recorded in the central barrio of Kapangan, and those of the
<i>ampasit</i> and <i>tanong</i>, which were recorded in the barrio of
Legleg, Kapangan. Kibungan is a town in the northwestern corner of
Benguet. It is inaccessible, and has been affected very little by
outside influence. It adjoins the Amburayan town of Bacun, and the
Lepanto town of Ampasungan. Legleg is about midway between Kibungan and
the Nabaloi boundary; the barrio of Kapangan is on the line between the
Nabaloi and Kankanay; and Buguias is in the northeastern part of
Benguet, north of the Nabaloi town of Kabayan. The dialect is spoken
with some difference of pronunciation in the various towns. It is
believed that all public ceremonies celebrated by the Benguet Kankanay
are described in this section, but some of the private ceremonies were
probably overlooked.</p>

<p>There was a man who had sugar cane. One morning when he went to see
his field, he saw that some one had stolen his sugar cane. Then one
night he hid to watch.</p>
<p>He saw many beautiful women come and hang their clothing on the
fence. He took the clothing of one and made a loud noise. The other
women took their clothing and flew away, but the one remaining could
not fly because her wings were fastened to her clothing.</p>
<p>She said to the man, &ldquo;Give me my clothing, because I am a star
and wish to fly away to the sky.&rdquo; But the man said, &ldquo;I will
not give you your clothing until you marry me.&rdquo; Then they
married, but he did not give her clothing to her. But the man hid the
clothing under the <i>dakalan</i><a class="noteref" id="xd20e3216src"
href="#xd20e3216" name="xd20e3216src">2</a> when she was not
looking.</p>
<p>From that time until three years (afterwards) they were married, and
they had two children. One day the woman started to change the
<i>dakalan</i>; while changing the <i>dakalan</i> she found her
clothing.</p>
<p>Then one of the children died. The mother continued to come to visit
the remaining child in the night, but would not come in the
daytime.</p>
<p>One night the mother of the child wanted to take it to the sky, but
the father saw his wife. That time they quarreled and agreed to split
the child in two. The mother took one half and made it alive; when the
half had been made alive it called loudly for the other half. But the
other half was rotten because the father was not able to make it live.
Then one night the mother made it alive and said, &ldquo;Answer your
half.&rdquo; Then it answered, but not loudly, because it was
rotten.</p>
<p>It became the Little Thunder, and the other half became the Big
Thunder. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href="#pb383" name=

This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:

Produced by Jeroen Hellingman and the Online Distributed
Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net/ for Project
Gutenberg (This file was produced from images generously
made available by The Internet Archive/American Libraries.)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
